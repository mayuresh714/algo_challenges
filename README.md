# algo_challenges

Welcome to my custom set of algorithmic challenges! 🚀

My goal is to create unique problems that teach how basic computing concepts work, and help you understand real-world complexities and constraints. These challenges are designed to go beyond standard textbook examples, focusing on practical scenarios and deeper insights into how algorithms operate under various limitations. 💡

If you share this passion and want to contribute your own creative problems, feel free to join in! Together, we can build a resource that makes learning algorithms fun, practical, and truly enlightening. 🤝
